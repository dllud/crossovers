Crossover point
===============
Many designs use 2000Hz or lower crossovers.
The ear is most sensitive in the 3kHz region so it's desired to try and keep the crossover out of that region. 

Piezos
======
 I use a 8 ohm, the higher wattage the better, resister that is placed in parallel with the driver. Also a series capacitor, usually 4.7uH will work, but it can be changed like any other tweeter. Last, I use an 8 ohm Pot which allows me to tone town the SPL. Keep in mind that with the 8 ohm resister placed in parallel with the tweeter, it can be treated as any 8 ohm driver.
 
Phase difference
================
It is commonly thought that there will always be a phase difference of 180Â° between the outputs of a (second order) low-pass filter and a high-pass filter having the same crossover frequency. And so, in a 2-way system, the high-pass section's output is usually connected to the high frequency driver 'inverted', to correct for this phase problem. For passive systems, the tweeter is wired with opposite polarity to the woofer; for active crossovers the high-pass filter's output is inverted. In 3-way systems the mid-range driver or filter is inverted. However, this is generally only true when the speakers have a wide response overlap and the acoustic centers are physically aligned.
